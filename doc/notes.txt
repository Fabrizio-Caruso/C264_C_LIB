IRQ/NMI pointers:
https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_16 
i.e., same as C64 and C128

Acknowledge:  $FF09 http://plus4world.powweb.com/forum/36070

Kernal shadow pointer: $0314/$0315

Kernal routines:
$CE0E keyboard support
$FCBE light-weight

NTSC: $FF07 bit6, 
double clock: $FF13 bit0 or 1?

$FF06: Default $1B (Similar to VIC-II $D011) [VIC_CTRL1]       
$FF07: Default $08/$48 PAL/NTSC (Similar to VIC-II $D016) [VIC_CTRL2]

$FF0B: Raster interrupt register. Same as VIC-II $D012 [VIC_HLINE] when writing; 
it stores the position of occurring raster interrupt. Highmost bit is in $FF0A's bit 0.

$FF0A: Interrupt mask register. These bits could be used to disable and enable interrupt-sources. When a place is set to 1, that will
be able to cause an interrupt to the processor. If not, the sign of the interrupt request will only be appear in the above register.
Bit 0 : 9th bit of $FF0B (see there)
Bit 1 : Raster-counter
